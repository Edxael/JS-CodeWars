// Description:
//
// "Keep up the hoop"
// Alex just got a new hula hoop, he loves it but feels discouraged because his little brother is better than him
//
// Write a program where Alex can input (n) how many times the hoop goes round and it will return him an encouraging message :)
//
// -If Alex gets 10 or more hoops, return the string "Great, now move on to tricks".
// -If he doesn't get 10 hoops, return the string "Keep at it until you get it".

}


var n = 18;
